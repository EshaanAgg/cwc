# CyberShield

This is a simple web-app that is used to host games that can challenge and educate people about the various kinds of attacks on phones and networks in general.

This was developed as a part of `Code with Cisco '23` Hackathon finals, for the theme `Where there is networking, there is security!` and the problem statement `2`. The project was ideated and made in less than 6 hours.

## Tech Stack

The site is built in `Next 13` and uses the `Material UI`.

The challenges are built in simple HTML, CSS and Javascript, and the `CaaS` challenge uses `Nginx` server and docker server.

The deployment and source code of all the challenges is available with them.
